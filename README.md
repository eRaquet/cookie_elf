# Cookie Elf 🧝
🍪 Cookies are getting claimed for Christmas! For each cookie claimed, one must give a gift to another, and another will give thee a gift. So simple.

Simply pass in a list of names at the top of `CookieElf.py`, and the Cookie Elf will assign each participant their list of gift assignments. So simple.

~~But wait... the algorithm is not quite right!! Find the problem, make it statistically sound, and submit a PR to save the day! 📊🎁~~  Now, through the flame and fury of eRaquet's technical brilliance, I have been taught wisdom beyond my years. 📚  I can now assign cookies with precision and elencance, bringing festivity and good cheer to all. ❄️  Merry Christmas! 🎄
